# Constant maps and aperiodicity

Convention: `Function.End Q` multiplies by composition, `(f * g) x = f (g x)`.

* `constEnd q` — the constant map `_ ↦ q`, and the predicate `IsConstEnd`;
* `constEnd_mul` — constant maps are left zeros: `constEnd p * t = constEnd p`;
* `eq_constEnd_of_R_constEnd` — anything `R`-related to a constant map is that constant map;
* `isAperiodicElem_of_id_or_const` — in a submonoid of `Function.End Q` whose elements are
  all the identity or constant maps, every element is aperiodic. This is what makes the reset
  monoids used in the decomposition genuine aperiodic factors.

/-! ## Reset / rank-drop transformations: the constant maps

A transformation `t : Function.End Q` *drops rank* if it is not
surjective.  For `Q` with at least two points, the extreme rank-drop — rank `1` — is a
**constant map**
`constEnd q : Q → Q`, `_ ↦ q`.  The constant maps are the aperiodic building
blocks of the reset monoids used in the decomposition.

`Function.End Q` has multiplication `(f * g) x = f (g x)` and unit
`1 = id`.  Under this convention:

* `constEnd p * t = constEnd p` — a constant map **absorbs on the left**;
* `t * constEnd q = constEnd (t q)` — composing a constant on the *right*
  yields the constant `constEnd (t q)`;

so the constant maps form a **two-sided ideal** of `Function.End Q`, and
among themselves `constEnd p * constEnd q = constEnd p`, i.e. they form a
**left-zero semigroup**.  Left-zero semigroups are aperiodic, and any
transformation monoid all of whose non-identity elements are constants is
therefore aperiodic. -/

/-! ### Aperiodicity of constant transformation monoids

The constant maps are aperiodic.  The key observation is purely
multiplicative: **anything `R`-related (inside `Function.End Q`) to a
constant map equals that constant map** — because `constEnd p * s`
is *always* `constEnd p` (left absorption: `(constEnd p * s) x =
constEnd p (s x) = p`), so `constEnd p * s = b` forces `b = constEnd p`.
Hence any two `H`-related constants are equal.

(Note the convention: `Function.End Q` has `(f * g) x = f (g x)`, so a
constant map absorbs *on the left* of a product — it is a *left zero* of
the monoid — and it is `Green.R` that collapses constants, not `Green.L`.) -/

/-- **Anything right-related to a constant map is that constant map.**  If
`Green.R (constEnd p) b` holds in `Function.End Q`, then `b = constEnd p`.
(`Green.R` provides `s` with `constEnd p * s = b`, and `constEnd p * s`
collapses to `constEnd p` by left absorption.) -/
theorem eq_constEnd_of_R_constEnd {p : Q} {b : Function.End Q}
    (h : Green.R (constEnd p) b) : b = constEnd p := by
  obtain ⟨s, _t, hs, _ht⟩ := h
  rw [← hs, constEnd_mul]

/-! ### Reset-monoid aperiodicity: monoids of constants-plus-identity

A transformation monoid `S ≤ Function.End Q` *all of whose non-identity
elements are constant maps* is aperiodic.  This is the structure of the reset
monoids used in the decomposition (the identity together with constant maps).

We phrase the aperiodicity hypothesis on a `Submonoid (Function.End Q)`. -/

/-- **A constants-plus-identity transformation monoid is aperiodic.**  Let
`S` be a submonoid of `Function.End Q` such that every element of `S` is
*either the identity or a constant map* (`hS`).  Then every element of `S`
is aperiodic: any two `H`-related elements `a, b ∈ S` are equal.

Proof by cases on `a`:
* if `a` is constant, `H a b` gives `Green.R a b`, so
  `eq_constEnd_of_R_constEnd` forces `b = a`;
* if `a = 1`, `H 1 b` gives `Green.R 1 b`, providing `t` with
  `(1 : Function.End Q) * t = b` *and* `b * t' = 1`.  If `b` is also `1`
  we are done; if `b` is a constant `constEnd q`, then `b * t' = constEnd q`
  by left absorption, so `constEnd q = 1`, i.e. `Q` is subsingleton, and
  then `Function.End Q` is subsingleton so `a = b` regardless.

The conclusion is stated with `H` unfolded into explicit `L`- and `R`-witnesses. -/
